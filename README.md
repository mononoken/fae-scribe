# # Ruby Scribe

<!-- ![A screenshot showing a preview of the project.](screenshot.png "Project Preview") -->

This app is for note-taking on your tabletop adventures! Its goal is to make navigating your past notes easier than with a physical journal, but it also emphasizes paying attention to the game in front of you while you input notes. It achieves this through its "Adventure/Library" modes.

If you are interested in seeing features that are being worked on, please see our (issues)[https://github.com/mononoken/ruby-scribe/issues].
